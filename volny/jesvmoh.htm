Ministries, Andrew Neckar<br>
</strong></font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed was the
prophet of war; Christ is the Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6-7).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed's
disciples killed for the faith; Christ's disciples were killed
for their faith (Acts 12:2; 2 Timothy 4:7).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed promoted
persecution against the &quot;infidels&quot;; Christ forgave and
converted the chief persecutor (1 Timothy 1:13-15).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed was the
taker of life; Christ was the giver of life (John 10:27-28).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed and his
fellow warriors murdered thousands; Christ murdered none but
saved many (compare John 12:48).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed's method
was COMPULSION; Christ's aim was voluntary CONVERSION (Acts
3:19).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed practiced
FORCE; Christ preached FAITH (John 6:29, 35).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed was a
WARRIOR; Christ is a DELIVERER (Col. 1:13; 1 Thessalonians 1:10).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed conquered
his enemies with the sword; Christ conquered his enemies with
another kind of sword, the sword of the Spirit which is the Word
of God (Hebrews 4:12; Acts 2:37).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed said to
the masses, &quot;Convert or die!&quot;; Christ said,
&quot;Believe and live!&quot; (John 6:47; 11:25-26).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed was swift
to shed blood (Romans 3:15-17); Christ shed His own blood for the
salvation of many (Ephesians 1:7).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed preached
&quot;Death to the infidels!&quot;; Christ prayed &quot;Father,
forgive them, for they know not what they do&quot; (Luke 23:34).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed declared
a holy war (Jihad) against infidels; Christ achieved a holy
victory on Calvary's cross (Colossians 2:14-15) and His followers
share in that victory (John 16:33).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed
constrained people by conquest; Christ constrained people by love
(2 Corinthians 5:14).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Modern terrorists
derive their inspiration from Mohammed and carry out their
despicable atrocities in the name of his god; Christians derive
their inspiration from the One who said, &quot;Blessed are the
peacemakers&quot; (Matthew 5:9).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Modern day
disciples of Mohammed respond to the terrorist attacks by
cheering in the streets; Modern day disciples of Christ are
deeply grieved at past atrocities carried out by those who were
&quot;Christians&quot; in name only (the Crusades, the Spanish
Inquisition, etc.).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Many Muslims are
peaceful and peace-loving because they do not strictly follow the
teachings of their founder; Many Christians are peaceful and
peace-loving because they do strictly follow the teachings of
their Founder (Romans 12:17-21).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed said the
Koran is authoritative only in Arabic, and only in his dialect;
The Bible is authoritative in many languages around the world,
for God knows all things and can inspire (and preserve) His Word
in more than one language.</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed hated
music; Jesus and His disciples sang hymns, and the Apostle
commanded the Lord's Church to sing. (Matthew 26:30, Ephesians
5:19, Colossians 3:16).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed allowed
that a Mullah, Imam, or Mufti of Islam can be a terrorist and an
amoral animal like Osama bin Laden; The Bible requires that a
leader in the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ must be above
reproach, and when this is not true, Christians demand such a
fallen leader be removed from leadership. (1 Timothy 3:1-7,
5:19-20).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Islam calls on its
followers to observe Five Pillars, while all other aspects of
life can be vulgar and not affect the Muslim's prospects in
Paradise. The Bible calls on the Christian to submit to the total
change of his life by the Spirit of God -- NO area of life and
thought is the choice of the follower. (Romans 12:1-2).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">The Muslim looks
forward to eternity in Paradise where there will be virgins who
are used for eternal perpetual copulation.</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">The Bible
believing Christian looks forward to being with Jesus Christ and
is delighted with that. (2 Corinthians 5:8).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed said the
witness of a woman was half the value of the witness of a man;
and Muhammed said a woman goes to Paradise because she satisfies
her husband sexually; The Bible teaches that a husband is to love
his wife and be willing to die for her. (Ephesians 5:25).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed called
upon his servants to fight; Jesus said, &quot;My kingdom is not
of this world; if My kingdom were of this world, then would My
servants fight . . . but now is My kingdom not from hence&quot;
(John 18:36).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed ordered
death to the Jews (see A. Guillaume, The Life of Muhammad, Oxford
University Press [1975], p. 369); Christ ordered that the gospel
be preached &quot;to the Jew first&quot; (Romans 1:16).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">The Koran says,
&quot;Fight in the cause of Allah&quot; (Qur'an 2:244); The
Bible says, &quot;we wrestle not against flesh and blood&quot;
and &quot;the weapons of our warfare are not carnal&quot;
(Ephesians 6:12; 2 Corinthians 10:4).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">The Koran says,
&quot;Fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them&quot;
(Qur'an 9:5); Christ said, &quot;Preach the gospel to every
creature&quot; (Mark 16:15).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">The Koran says,
&quot;I will inspire terror into the hearts of unbelievers&quot;
(Qur'an 8:12); God inspires His terror into the hearts of
believers (Isaiah 8:13).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">The Koran
(Qur'an) is a terrorist manual which condones fighting,
conflict, terror, slaughter, and genocide against those who do
not accept Islam; The Bible is a missionary manual to spread the
gospel of peace to all the world (Romans 10:15).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed's Mission
was to conquer the world for Allah; Christ's mission was to
conquer sin's penalty and power by substitutionary atonement (2
Corinthians 5:21; 1 Peter 3:18).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed
considered Christ a good prophet; Christ pronounced Mohammed to
be a false prophet (John 10:10; Matthew 24:11).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed claimed
that there was but one God, Allah; Christ claimed that He was God
(John 10:30-31; John 8:58-59; John 5:18; John 14:9).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Islam is
geocentric, that is, the whole universe is centered on the Kaaba
in the Grand Mosque in Mecca in Arabia, and all Muslims pray
facing that direction; Jesus Christ is the center of all
Christian worship and fellowship, for He is &quot;in the
midst&quot; where his saints meet anywhere on earth. (Matthew
18:20, John 4:22-23).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Mohammed's Tomb:
OCCUPIED! Christ's tomb: EMPTY!</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Islam must be
received, or you can be killed for rejecting it:</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">The Faith offered
by Jesus Christ is for &quot;whosoever will&quot; to receive, and
all men are permitted to reject it. (Revelation 22:17, John
3:16).</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Those who leave
Islam are killed in most Islamic nations; Those who leave the
true Church of Jesus Christ are allowed to do so with no revenge.</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">Now, is a Muslim
submitted to Allah and Islam because he loves Allah? NO!</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">He dare not leave
Islam, and he is loyal purely out of fear.</font></p>

<p><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">The true Bible
believer is loyal to Jesus Christ purely out of love. &quot;There
is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because
fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
We love him, because he first loved us.&quot; (1 John 4:18-19)</font></p>

<p align="left"><FONT color="#000000" size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial">This
concept is 100% alien to Islam - there is no love in Islam - only
fear and hate.</font><FONT size="3" face="Arial CE,Arial"><br>
